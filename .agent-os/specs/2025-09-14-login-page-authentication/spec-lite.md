# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement secure login page authentication for BalanceHub that supports both email/password login for employees and Microsoft Entra ID OAuth for managers. The system provides role-based access control, secure token management, and seamless redirection to appropriate dashboards (timer hub for employees, manager analytics for leadership roles).

User authentication happens via secure API endpoints, with JWT tokens issued upon successful validation and persistent session management through local storage. Error handling ensures clear user feedback without exposing sensitive details.
