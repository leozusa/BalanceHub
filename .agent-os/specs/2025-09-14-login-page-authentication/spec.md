# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Login Page Authentication
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Implement secure user authentication for BalanceHub with both email/password and OAuth integration to enable role-based access to the productivity dashboard. This feature will provide seamless login experience while ensuring data security and appropriate user routing.

## User Stories

### Employee Email/Password Login

As an Employee, I want to log in using my email and password so that I can access my personalized productivity dashboard and track my tasks securely.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters email and password fields
3. System validates input format (email syntax, password length)
4. User clicks "Login" button
5. System sends authentication request to backend API
6. Backend validates credentials against user database
7. Upon success, JWT token is issued with user role as "employee"
8. User is redirected to main timer hub dashboard
9. On failure, error message displays explaining issue

### Manager OAuth Authentication

As a Manager, I want to authenticate using Microsoft Entra ID OAuth so that I can access team analytics and feedback data securely without remembering separate credentials.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User navigates to login page
2. User selects manager role via toggle
3. User clicks "Login with Microsoft" OAuth button
4. System redirects to Microsoft Entra ID login page
5. User completes Microsoft authentication
6. Microsoft returns authorization code
7. System exchanges code for user tokens and profile information
8. System creates/updates user record with manager role
9. JWT token issued with "manager" role
10. User redirected to manager dashboard
11. Error case: display Microsoft login failure message

## Spec Scope

1. **Login Form UI** - Email and password input fields with client-side validation for format and required fields
2. **OAuth Integration** - Microsoft Entra ID OAuth button for manager authentication flow
3. **Role Selector** - Toggle switch or dropdown for Employee/Manager mode selection
4. **Remember Me Functionality** - Checkbox for persistent login sessions
5. **Forgot Password Link** - Visual link placeholder (no implementation needed)
6. **Error Message Display** - Clear error notifications for login failures
7. **Success Redirects** - Automatic routing to timer hub or manager dashboard based on role
8. **Responsive Design** - Login page works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Out of Scope

- User registration functionality
- Password reset/recovery workflow
- Password strength policies for registration
- Multi-factor authentication options
- Password hashing implementations (handled by secure backend)
- Multiple OAuth providers (only Microsoft Entra ID required)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Login page renders completely with all form elements visible and functional on browser
2. Successful email/password login results in redirect to employee timer hub dashboard with valid session
3. Successful OAuth login results in redirect to manager dashboard with appropriate session
4. Authentication tokens persist session correctly and validate on subsequent API calls
5. Error states display appropriate user-friendly messages without exposing security details
